Take one for the team
Move like a wave
You have to find your own frequency
A moment that you will never see
Dreamer of your dream
Where the hell you been?
We threw all our riches in the sea
Now that you know there's no victory
Heavenly symphony
You can feel it everywhere
Static building
Truth is singing, just hear it
One and one isn't two
Every time we never know
Anything will happen
We gotta get out of here
Such a desperate future
Don't you get used to
Being abused
And if it hurts, the truth that we find in the
tundra
Hey, I'd rather rip the bandage off
Than end up rotten to the core
現状はただ絶望でも
光は海の底 誰もが知らぬとこ
Made me change まだ 半分だけだ
ただただ流されて　ゆらゆら身を任せ
足跡たどることもできず
本当　うそ　過去　未来　金輪際
のぞみを捨てる気はないなら
まだ消えない
We gotta get out of here
Such a desperate future
Don't you get used to
Being abused
And if it hurts, the truth that we find in the
tundra
Hey, I'd rather rip the bandage off
Than end up rotten to the core
We'll never surrender
The tat on my shoulder
We gotta move forward
We'll make the next border
We'll never surrender
The tat on my shoulder
We gotta move forward
We'll make the next border
We gotta get out of here
Such a desperate future
Don't you get used to
Being abused
And if it hurts, the truth that we find in the
tundra
Hey, I'd rather rip the bandage off
Than end up rotten to the core
We'll never surrender
The tat on my shoulder
We gotta move forward
We'll make the next border
We'll never surrender
The tat on my shoulder
We gotta move forward
We'll make the next border
